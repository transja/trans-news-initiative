Subsequently, we asked two teams of subject matter experts to manually label the events with the 13 overarching (non-exclusive) themes listed below. This created a sample of roughly 8,000 theme-labelled news articles, which were used to train a classifier that subsequently applied the overarching theme labels to all other news articles.
